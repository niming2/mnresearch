I'm a plant ecologist working with Prof. Mark Vellend at Universite de Sherbrooke. Mainly focusing on plants in eastern North America, my phd research work is about how soil properties influence plant distribution and migration under climate change, and the evolutionary history of plant soil niches. I finished my undergraduate and master study at Sun Yat-Sen University, studying plant invasions in China.
